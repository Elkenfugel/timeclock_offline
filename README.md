## Project Goals
* Make it as convenient as possible to enter time worked.
* Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should have:
  * Continually update/display time worked for day, week, and month.
  * Automatically display time worked for day, week, and month.
  * Allow user to set day and week cutoff.
  * Allow user to analyze arbitrary range of days.
  * Ability to separate multiple different jobs
  * Optional wage entry and compensation earned calculation
  * User authentication
  * Server and database
  * Proper security measures on backend to prevent unauthorized data access.
* Get working MVP as quickly as possible.
* After MVP, add timeclock feature to allow user to "punch in" and "punch out" so that they don't have to write down their time and enter it later.
